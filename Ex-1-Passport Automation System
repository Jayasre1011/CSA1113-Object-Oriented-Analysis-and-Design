# Experiment 1: Passport Automation System

## Aim
To model the Passport Automation System using Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) concepts by creating UML diagrams in StarUML.

## Software Used
- StarUML
- UML 2.x

## Procedure
1. Opened StarUML and created a new UML project.
2. Analyzed the Passport Automation System to identify actors, processes, and objects.
3. Drew the Use Case Diagram to represent interactions between Applicant, Passport Officer, and Police Department.
4. Created the Class Diagram to represent system classes and their relationships.
5. Designed the Sequence Diagram to show the interaction flow between system components.
6. Developed the Activity Diagram to illustrate the workflow of passport application processing.
7. Drew the State Diagram to represent the life cycle of the passport application.
8. Created the Communication Diagram to show object interactions using numbered messages.
9. Designed the Component Diagram to represent the software components of the system.
10. Drew the Deployment Diagram to show the physical deployment of the system.
11. Created the Package Diagram to show the logical grouping of system modules.
12. Verified all diagrams for correctness and saved the project.

## Result
The Passport Automation System was successfully modeled using nine UML diagrams in StarUML, demonstrating the functional, structural, behavioral, and deployment aspects of the system.
